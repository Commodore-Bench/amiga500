# RE-Amiga500
Amiga 500+ v8a Re-Imagined.

These files are generated from schematics. Not from a printed circuit board via Sprint (like my A2000 I will soon release)
https://www.amigawiki.org/dnl/schematics/A500_R6.pdf 

I manually routed these traces. The component positioning needs to be checked for accuracy and the mounting holes (at time of release need to be added)

I am releasing these for people to use not for commercial purposes to keep the Amiga alive. It is part of who I am and will live on with me forever along this journey.
